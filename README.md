# secure-password-generator
Creates a secure random password at the user's request.

# Introduction
This should be a one page program that will create a random secure password at the user's specifications.

# Initial completion
Initially I setup the website to be responsive using bootstrap to minimize the need to write a customized CSS.
The program uses an imported javascript rather than one built into the index page so the script can be used elseware.

# 1/7/20
User specs are not defined yet, but the page will create a 10 charicter secure random password for the user and copy
said password to the clipboard with the click of two buttons. One to generate the password, the other to copy it.
